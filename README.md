# Quizz Game  
A simple and engaging game where the player answers a series of questions to try and win the game. The game tests the player's knowledge across different topics and keeps track of their score as they progress.  

## Getting Started  
These instructions will help you set up the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.  

### Prerequisites  
Ensure you have the following installed:  
- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)  

### Installing  
Follow these steps to get a development environment running:  

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/quiz-game.git
   cd quiz-game
2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python quiz_game.py

## Running the test
This project includes automated tests to verify functionality and coding style.

### End-To-End Tests
The tests verify that the game correctly handles user input and calculates scores. Run them using: pytest tests/test_quiz_game.py

### Coding Style Tests 
To ensure consistent code formatting, use a linter like Flake8: flake8 quiz_game.py

## Deployment 
To deploy the game on a live system, package the project using a Python packaging tool like PyInstaller or host it as a web application with a framework like Flask (future enhancement).
